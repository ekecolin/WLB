Overview

This project, conducted by Osebor Evbodaghe, Shaina Emily Rebello, Colin Ekedigwe, and Advaith Aravinda Bijoor at Dublin City University, investigates the relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and employee performance in competitive industries like information technology. Using the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, we analyzed two large datasets with over 100,000 employee records to explore whether WLB directly impacts performance metrics such as productivity and task quality, with a focus on the mediating role of psychological empowerment.

The study combines statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover patterns in WLB policies (e.g., remote work, overtime) and their effects on performance. Our findings challenge the assumption that WLB directly enhances performance, offering insights for organizations on how to approach WLB initiatives and performance evaluations.
